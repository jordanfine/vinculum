A Visual Novel Game for PC, Mac OS, Linux

### Developing Vinculum

Create a branch based off the level you are working on (i.e dock, bar,etc). If you are working on something that is more general and not related to a specific scene (like the UserInterface scripts), then name the branch based off the feature. 

**Never push anything to develop or master if it's broken!**

#### Common git commands (examples):

` git status ` see what has been changed since last commit

`git branch` see what branch you are on

`git pull origin develop` retrieve the updated contents of a branch named develop

`git commit -am "Fixed the Boat animation"` commits the fixes you made with a message detailing what you did. Be a little more specific though! :)

`git push origin barscene` push your commits to the 'barscene' branch

*Probably more git commands you will use, let me know if you need help. [Click here for more git reference](http://gitref.org/).*


Make sure your editor settings in Unity are setup like this:
